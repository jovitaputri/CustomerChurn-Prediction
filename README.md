# Predicting Customer Churn: Insights and Solutions Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project investigates how machine learning can be used to predict customer churn, a major issue that affects long-term business stability. By examining customer demographics, financial activity, and behavioral patterns, the study aims to understand why customers leave a service and how companies can respond before it happens.

## Purpose
The main aim is to develop a reliable churn prediction model and identify the factors that most strongly influence customer loyalty. The results are intended to help businesses build more effective retention plans, reduce potential revenue loss, and improve long-term relationships with their customers.

## Core System
The project uses several machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Means clustering. After tuning, the Random Forest model performs the best with an accuracy of 87 percent and stronger recall for customers likely to churn. Logistic Regression provides a solid baseline, while K-Means adds an extra layer of insight by grouping customers into segments that reveal different behavioral tendencies.

## Data Insights
Key features such as Age, Balance, and Number of Products play a significant role in predicting churn. The analysis shows that behavioral and financial variables are more impactful than demographic ones, suggesting that personalized interaction and service quality matter more than general customer profiles.

## Impact
This project highlights how data-driven analysis can support smarter business decisions. By applying machine learning to churn prediction, companies can detect early warning signs, focus their attention on high-risk customers, and design targeted strategies that improve satisfaction and encourage long-term loyalty.
